## Implementation Progress

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Step 1 - Audit Current Responsive Breakpoints**
**Date Completed**: Current

**Findings**:
- **Breakpoint Usage**: Using Tailwind's default breakpoints (sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px, 2xl: 1536px)
- **Desktop-First Patterns Identified**: 
  - Navigation text hidden on small screens (`hidden sm:inline`, `hidden md:inline`)
  - Layout switching at md breakpoint (768px) - sidebar collapses below this
  - Bottom navigation only shows on mobile (`md:hidden`)
  - Grid layouts default to single column, expand at md/lg breakpoints
  - Padding systems inconsistent (p-2 md:p-4)
- **Critical Issues**:
  - 23 instances of desktop-first responsive patterns
  - Touch targets not optimized (using default button sizes)
  - Layout assumes desktop-first approach with mobile as afterthought

**Next Steps**: Convert these patterns to mobile-first approach starting with navigation.

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Step 2 - Setup Mobile-First Development Environment**

## Bug Fixes & Refinements

### 🔧 **FIXED: Tab Navigation UI Breaking Issue**
**Date Fixed**: Current
**Issue**: Tab navigation became too large after implementing touch targets, breaking the header UI
**Root Cause**: Applied `min-w-touch min-h-touch` (44px) to tab triggers, making them oversized

**Solution Applied**:
- **Reduced tab trigger size**: Changed from 44px to 40px height (still touch-friendly)
- **Optimized minimum width**: Set `min-w-[60px]` for better proportions
- **Improved icon scaling**: Responsive icon sizes (16px mobile → 20px desktop)
- **Better text handling**: `hidden sm:inline` for clean mobile/desktop experience

**Files Modified**:
- `components/layout.tsx`: Fixed tab sizing and responsive behavior

**Result**: Tab navigation now has proper proportions while maintaining touch-friendliness and accessibility.

**Server Status**: Development server running at http://localhost:3005
